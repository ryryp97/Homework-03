# Homework-03

This repository contains a program that runs on a webpage that can generate passwords.  The primary purpose for its creation was to practice working with JavaScript algorithms.

The site can be reached here: [Password Generator](https://ryryp97.github.io/Homework-03/)

What the site looks like:

### Usage

The main usage for this site is to generate passwords.  Clicking on the "generate password" button will prompt the user to enter a number value for the desired length of their password.  Once a valid number is entered, the next 4 prompts that pop up let the user decide what kind of character they want in their password: lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters.  Then, if at least one of those character types were selected, the password should be generated and will pop up in the form of an alert.

### Credits 

I'd like to thank [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and their JavaScript guides, they were a great help.
